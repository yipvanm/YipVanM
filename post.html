            <p>For my third portfolio for class I made a story on Twine.
              <br>Click <a href="twine485.html">here</a> to try it!</p>
            <p>I chose to make a two part story about Pompeii. One side is from the perspective of a person living in Pompeii the day of the eruption, and the other is from the perspective of an archaeologist in 1963 who is excavating the site. I got this idea from something our professor showed us in class about Mexican people crossing the border, seen from their point of view and they coyote’s point of view (people who help people over the border). I chose Pompeii because I find it fascinating. The volcano erupted in 79AD, so it has been nearly 2,000 years and this whole city is still preserved. 
<br>I think that writing something like this and using Twine to make it engaging is a good way to allow people to learn about history and archaeology. The reader/interactor is able to choose different paths to take that lead to different outcomes. They are in control of the story they get, while still learning. The two different perspectives interact in that the main character in the Pompeii story is found by the archaeologist in the archaeology story. I am hoping that readers/interactors will try all the outcomes so they will see similarities! 
<br>Twine is relatively easy to use, and it is really fun to design. I had no idea how to publish the file to my blog, but luckily one of my group-mates from a previous project was able to help. This was very difficult, and would have taken me much more time had she not been there to help. In the future, I now know how to publish Twine files, so I should not have this problem again! Another thing that was difficult about this project is that I made it way too big. I had such ideas and expectations, but this would have required hours of research to actually write a historically correct story. I ended up combining a few outcomes to make it more feasible. If I had more time or wanted to make it bigger in general, I would have liked to do this research. I already have nearly 40 passages in my story! 
<br>I think that if people are interested in something I created in digital archaeology, and they are able to learn something from it, it is successful. I get to learn and use all these different programs, and people get to use and experience my creations to learn more about my field. This class has left me with much useful knowledge!

            <h1>Project with the RBCM</h1>              
            <p>For our project we made an interactive map of the three excavation sites around Victoria. We got a board, printed a map, hammered in holes so we could put conductive tape through the board, and connected it all to a tool called Makey-Makey to allow people to hear sounds when the tape was touched. We went through many different ideas of how we could make this all happen before we settled on one way.
              Basically, we wanted to touch something and hear sounds. We used a tool called Makey-Makey to create circuits with the conductive tape. 
              We had one starting point at the front of the map that was the “Earth” or “Home” button; to start the sounds you had to touch the Earth button with one finger, and touch a different copper conductive tape strip somewhere else on the map with another finger, and then let go.
              We also decided to print some 3D objects to place on the map for visual stimulation and interaction. We printed a boat, some houses, bottle caps, a well, a bridge, a bowl, and a bottle.  
              In order to use the conductive tape, we had to hammer holes in the board for it to go through. This worked really well. We printed a map that we glued on the board, and painted the border gold.
              Our map ended up wokring really well. 
              People seemed surprised and pleased every time they touched the map and something happened. It was really great to see people get excited about our project and learn something about Victoria’s history at the same time. I think this is a good way to measure success in digital archaeology. People were interested, they were excited when something happened because of something they did them, and they were learning at the same time
              I think that a map like this would be an educational interactive thing to have in museums. It is great to be able to visualize where things are, and hear about them, and see what was found there, all at the same time.

            <h1>Bones of our Past</h1>
            <p>For our second portfolio project I created a website about <a href ="https://yipvanm.github.io/7wonders/">the 7 wonders of the ancient world</a>. I chose this for a few reasons;
              to start, it had to fit the theme "Bones of our Past", a project from <a href="http://www.heritagejam.org/about-2/">The Heritage Jam</a>.
              The Ancient Wonders are of the past, more specifically our human past, therefore by interpreting Bones of our Past as human past
              we can see how this project fits the theme.
              <br>Next, I chose the 7 wonders because it is something I wanted to learn more about. I had heard of the wonders before but have never 
              learned more about them. This project was the perfect opportunity to explore this interest.
              <br><br>
              For this project I mainly wanted to focus on making an interactive map. I tried out <a href="https://carto.com/">Carto</a> for the first time to make it, 
              and I definitely had some troubles. After spending a few hours at home being unable to even open myself a new map in the right location
              I gave up and asked my professor for help in our lab class. Dr. Cook helped me get started and I was able to make the map how I envisioned
              it to be. Once finished I tried to enter the url into my github pages but the url I had was not working. I finally figured out that there
              are multiple "publish" buttons that need to be clicked before you can get to the right url, I was using the wrong one.
              <br>When I finally had everything ready with the map on my website, I discovered I had made a mistake in the map, placing the Lighthouse
              of Alexandria in the wrong location. Some more time was spent on tinkering with the map to fix this mistake, but the lighthouse is now in the correct 
              place.
              <br><br>In the future I think I will keep working on learning digital arch one step at a time. It is hard to learn how to use all of these websites
              that make things for you, and how to insert things properly while coding, but with the help of Google, Dr. Cook, and the coursepack I think I will 
              manage. The main things that went wrong in my project were easily fixable with the right knowledge, so I will just keep learning as I go. 
              <br>Furthermore, I think that my finished project is quite successful. I was able to learn how to use new software, research something 
              I have been interested in for a long time, and create a learning experience for anyone visiting my website. I think that these three 
              facts make this project successful in digital archaeology. Learning and applying new software is very important for me as a digital 
              archaeologist, and creating something that other people can benefit from and learn from is what my goal is in this discipline.

                on October 5, 2017</span>
            <p>I made this website as a project for my anth 495 class.
              I designed this website to create a digital presence for myself in the realm of anthropology and archaeology. 
              I highlight two aspects of my life that I find very important; my educational career and my treeplanting adventures. 
              These two things describe me well so I decided to add them to my website and include photos of me doing what I love. </p>
            
            <p>At first I had no idea how to edit pages other than the index.html, 
              I was confused as to where the other pages were located in my <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> repository.
              Next I was confused about uploading images. I was not sure as to what size would work, so I spent awhile cropping and
              resizing images to the same size as the images the website came with, only to find that any of my horizontal images could 
              work without editing them. Vertical images, however, did not show.
              I was also unsure about where my posts would show up. I am still not sure how I am going to do it with future posts, 
              as I only have one "featured post" page. This is something I will think about over the next little while before my next post.
              In the end I think my project is quite sucessful; it creates a space for me to:</p> 
            <p>1. show my online presence in anthropology</p>
            <p>2. showcase my newfound skills (although very minimal) at coding</p>
            <p>3. host any future projects for this class and in my future anthropological career</p>
            <p>4. blog about said projects</p>
